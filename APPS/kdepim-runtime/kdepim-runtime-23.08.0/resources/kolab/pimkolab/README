= About =

Libkolab provides advanced calendaring functionality including:
* recurrence handling
* timezone handling
* iTip/iMip parsing/generating
* Freebusy generating

To implement most of the functionality, the kdepim libraries are used. The functionality of this library can be exposed via SWIG bindings to other languages.

Structure:
* kolabformatv2: Kolabformat v2 implementation from kdepim-runtime (moved here)
* kolabformat: Kolab object reading/writing (mime message + kolab-format). Handles v2/v3 transparently.
Currently this interface uses the KDE Containers, eventually we'd want one that uses the Kolab Containers and can be wrapped in SWIG bindings.
* conversion: Conversions from KDE to Kolab containers and vice verca.
* mime: Mime message handling used by kolabformat
* icalendar: Exposes iCalendar functionality: iCal reading/writing, iTip, iMip
* calendaring: Some general calendaring functions
* freebusy: Freebusy generating functions.
