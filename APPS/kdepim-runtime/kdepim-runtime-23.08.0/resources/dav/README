==== What's this ? ====

This is an Akonadi resource to access DAV-enabled PIM storages.

Calendars and todos are supported, using either GroupDAV
or CalDAV, and contacts are supported using GroupDAV or
CardDAV.


==== Usage ====

It should be pretty straightforward. The URL to use should be, if possible,
the principals URL for your server (CalDAV / CardDAV) or the parent
collection of your calendars to allow discovery.


==== Tested with / known bugs ====

Here is a list of servers tested with this resource with the URLs used.

    generated by KCal seems misinterpreted by SOGo : every event is
    shifted by the timezone offset (at least test with TZ Europe/Paris,
